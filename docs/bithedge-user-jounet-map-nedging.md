# sBTC Options Contract: User Journey Map (Hedging Focus)

## Introduction

Below is a revised User Journey Map for the sBTC Options Contract dApp, tailored to a user whose primary motivation is to hedge Bitcoin volatility, particularly during significant price drops. This version adjusts the context, persona, and journey to reflect this goal, while maintaining the same detailed structure you requested. The dApp remains a Stacks-based call option platform using sBTC and Clarity, but the user's perspective shifts to risk management rather than speculative profit.

- **Primary User Persona**: "Risk-Averse Rachel" â€“ A cautious Bitcoin holder seeking to protect against price drops.

- **User Goals**:

  - Hedge Bitcoin volatility by securing a low sBTC purchase price.
  - Minimize losses if Bitcoin drops significantly.
  - Use a secure, decentralized tool tied to Bitcoin's stability.
