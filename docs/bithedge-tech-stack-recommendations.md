## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. Frontend Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

**Rationale**: While a simple Vite React app could work for a basic MVP, BitHedge's multi-view architecture, SEO requirements (especially for the Landing Page), and need for both static and dynamic content make Next.js the superior choice.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for the Landing Page and documentation sections
- **React Server Components** for improved performance and reduced client-side JavaScript
- **Built-in routing** with layout support matching BitHedge's multi-view architecture
- **API routes** for interfacing with external services (price feeds)
- **Image optimization** for responsive design
- **Strong TypeScript support** for type safety across the codebase

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use the App Router for modern, nested routing capabilities
- Leverage Server Components for non-interactive UI elements
- Set up API routes for external data fetching to hide API keys

### 2. UI & Styling: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + Lucide React

**Rationale**: BitHedge requires a polished, accessible UI with consistent design language across multiple views. The shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS provides the flexibility and customization needed while maintaining design consistency.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Accessible components** that follow WAI-ARIA standards
- **Customizable design tokens** allowing theme alignment with BitHedge design system
- **Utility-first CSS approach** reducing stylesheet bloat
- **Component customization** without fighting against opinionated libraries
- **Copy-paste component approach** rather than package imports for maximum flexibility

**Implementation Notes**:

- Create a design system configuration with BitHedge's color palette and typography
- Extend shadcn/ui with custom components for option trading interfaces
- Use Lucide React for consistent iconography across the application
- Implement dark/light mode support built on CSS variables

### 3. Animations: Framer Motion

**Rationale**: BitHedge needs smooth transitions between views and interactive elements that respond to user actions. Framer Motion provides a powerful animation system that works well with React's component model.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Declarative animations** that integrate well with React's mental model
- **Gesture support** for interactive elements like sliders and option selectors
- **Advanced transitions** between views and states
- **Animation orchestration** for sequenced animations
- **AnimatePresence** for exit animations when components unmount

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use subtle animations for state changes and transitions
- Implement gesture-based interactions for the option configuration sliders
- Ensure animations have reduced-motion alternatives for accessibility

### 4. State Management: Zustand

**Rationale**: BitHedge has complex state requirements across different views, including wallet connection, contract state, and UI state. Zustand offers a lightweight yet powerful solution that scales well with application complexity.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Simple API** with hooks-based access to state
- **Minimal boilerplate** compared to Redux
- **TypeScript support** for type-safe state
- **Middleware support** for integration with persistent storage
- **Immutable updates** ensuring predictable state changes
- **Devtools integration** for debugging state changes

**Implementation Notes**:

- Create separate stores for different domains (wallet, options, market data)
- Implement middleware for persisting wallet connection across sessions
- Use selectors to optimize renders and derive computed state

### 5. Routing: Next.js App Router

**Rationale**: BitHedge's multi-view architecture requires sophisticated routing with nested layouts and loading states. Next.js App Router provides these capabilities out of the box.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Nested layouts** supporting the shared navigation across views
- **Loading and error states** for asynchronous data fetching
- **Route groups** for organizing code by feature
- **Parallel routes** for complex UI patterns
- **Intercepting routes** for modal-based workflows

**Implementation Notes**:

- Organize routes by feature (landing, home, easy-option, option-data)
- Implement a shared layout for authenticated views
- Use loading states for blockchain data fetching

### 6. API Integration: Stacks.js + Custom React Hooks

**Rationale**: Integration with the Stacks blockchain is central to BitHedge. Stacks.js provides the necessary APIs, but wrapping them in custom React hooks improves developer experience and ensures consistent error handling.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Declarative data fetching** with React hooks
- **Consistent error handling** across blockchain interactions
- **Caching and revalidation** for efficient data access
- **TypeScript integration** for type-safe blockchain calls

**Implementation Notes**:

- Create custom hooks for common operations (useWalletConnect, useContractCall, etc.)
- Implement caching layer for blockchain data with appropriate staleness configs
- Set up error boundaries to handle blockchain interaction failures gracefully

### 7. Data Visualization: Recharts + D3.js

**Rationale**: BitHedge's Option Data View requires sophisticated charts and visualizations. Recharts provides React-friendly charts while D3.js enables more complex custom visualizations.

**Key Benefits**:

- **React component model** for charts with Recharts
- **Responsive by default** adapting to different screen sizes
- **Animation support** for data transitions
- **Accessibility features** for screen readers
- **D3.js power** for complex visualizations like heatmaps and options chains

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use Recharts for standard charts (line, bar, area)
- Leverage D3.js for custom visualizations (options chain matrix, heat maps)
- Implement responsive designs that work across device sizes
- Add touch interaction support for mobile devices

### 8. Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod

**Rationale**: BitHedge's Easy Option View requires efficient form handling with validation. React Hook Form with Zod provides a performant solution with strong TypeScript integration.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Uncontrolled components** for better performance
- **Schema-based validation** with Zod
- **TypeScript integration** for type-safe forms
- **Low bundle size** impact compared to alternatives

**Implementation Notes**:

- Create validation schemas for option configuration
- Implement form steps for the Easy Option View
- Add real-time validation for immediate feedback

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI components
2. **State Updates**: Zustand stores update based on interactions
3. **Blockchain Interactions**: Custom hooks call Stacks.js functions
4. **State Synchronization**: Blockchain results update Zustand stores
5. **UI Updates**: Components re-render with updated state

## Trade-offs and Alternatives

### Alternative: Vite + React Router

**Pros**:

- Simpler setup for pure SPA

**Cons**:

- Better for server state than UI state
- Would likely still need Zustand for non-server state

### Alternative: Chakra UI for Component Library

**Pros**:

- More out-of-the-box components
- Built-in animation support

**Cons**:

- Less customizable
- Larger bundle size
- More opinionated design system

## Development Tools
