# UI/UX Design Approach: Option Data View

## Introduction

As a senior UI/UX designer, I'm proposing a comprehensive Option Data View for BitHedge that delivers advanced market analytics and visualizations for Bitcoin options. This view is designed based on the "option-data-overview," "option-data-open-interest-volume," and "option-data-implied-volatility" reference images, creating a data-rich environment for more sophisticated users while maintaining accessibility for "Risk-Averse Rachel" when she's ready to dive deeper. This view will provide comprehensive market insights without overwhelming users, using thoughtful information architecture and progressive disclosure.

## Design Goals

- **Market Transparency**: Present comprehensive options market data in an organized, digestible format
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide multiple visualization types (charts, tables, heatmaps) for different analysis needs
- **Educational Value**: Help users understand options metrics through contextual information
- **Decision Support**: Aid in identifying optimal strike prices, premiums, and expiration dates
- **Visual Cohesion**: Maintain BitHedge's design language while accommodating complex data

## Visual Components & Layout
