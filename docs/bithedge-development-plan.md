## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured approach to implementing the BitHedge platform within the hackathon timeframe. By following this plan, the team will focus on delivering core functionality first, ensuring a working product by the submission deadline while progressively enhancing features as time permits. Regular testing and integration checkpoints will help identify issues early, and the phased approach allows for flexibility in adjusting priorities based on progress.

The plan balances technical debt against feature delivery, ensuring that the final product demonstrates the key innovations of BitHedge while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. With careful execution and adherence to the timeline, the team should successfully deliver a compelling options trading platform leveraging sBTC on the Stacks blockchain by the May 20th deadline.
