This is a placeholder. You'll need to convert the SVG to an ICO file.

To manually create this file:
1. Convert the SVG to multiple PNG sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
2. Use a tool like https://www.icoconverter.com/ to convert these to an ICO file
3. Replace this placeholder with the actual ICO file

Or use an online SVG to ICO converter.
